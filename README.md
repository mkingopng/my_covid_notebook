# my_covid_notebook

This project started as a univerity assessment. It has been submitted and the marks were pretty good, however it feels incomplete.

- The data continues to evolve
- there more sophisticated ways to automate keepin data up-to-date (eg the JSSE data repo now has a python API)
- the visualisations demand some interactivity
- we were requried to submit the notebook with code visisble, but i want to reconsider that
- it may be that dashboard is a more interesting way of presenting and keeping data up to date

- i intend to explore various methods for inference/predicition, randing from traditional statistical approach (Vector Auto regression) to deep learning
